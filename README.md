1. Get a Github account.
2. Create a repository with the browser. Make sure you check the
'Initialize this repository with a README' box! You can skip the
.gitignore and license dropdowns, but you *must* create a README.
3. Press the green 'Create Repository' button.

Now you have a repository. See, for example,
https://github.com/znmeb/demo-for-stephen-doig. There's nothing in it
but that README file, which Github is interpreting as Github-flavored
Markdown. If you're in a hurry, just fork my demo and go there with
prose.io.

Now browse to prose.io. You should see a button 'Authorize on Github'.
Press that and follow the instructions.
1. You'll get an 'Explore Projects' menu. I've got oodles of projects
on Github, but I'm going to the demo I just created. Press the 'View
Project' button.
2. You should see the 'README.md' file with an 'Edit' button. Press that.
3. Now you have a lightweight WYSIWYG-ish Markdown editor. It's
supposed to be 'intuitive'. ;-) But you can select text, format it,
etc., Mouse over the row of buttons on the right of the screen for
tool tips. The eyeball is the 'Preview' button. That shows you what
the fairly raw web page is going to look like.
4. When you get something you like, press the 'Save' icon and go back
to the Github repository.

On the right there's a 'Settings' button. Press that.
1. Scroll down to the 'Github Pages' section. Press the 'Automatic
Page Generator' button.
2. Press the 'Load README.md' button. This will import the file you
edited with prose.io
3. Scroll down to 'Continue to Layouts' and press it.
4. Pick one of the themes and press the green checkmark button.
5. Wait. You'll get an email when it's done, assuming you have that
enabled and there weren't any errors.
